		<h2>Why Matreshka?</h2>
		<p>Matreshka is innovative brand new framework that makes JS+DOM coding less painful. It opens new possibilities for developing fast, extendable and clean coded applications. Matreshka makes alot to keep your code compact that makes apps less sensitive to errors and makes you and your client happier.</p>
		
		<p>What does mean "innovative"? It means that Matreshka uses possibilities that recently came to modern browsers. More precisely, Matreshka uses accessors provided by Object.defineProperty function. A lot of cool methods such as "addDependency", "on", "setMediator", "defineGetter"... win developers hearts and makes them saying "Oh! I couldn't do so before." Don't forget that Matreshka has hacked Internet Explorer 8 for you :)</p>
		
		<h2>Data-UI bindings</h2>
		<p>The main goal of Matreshka is to make you forgetting about data-UI sync. So you can just add few rules how data should communicate with specified elements and that's all. From when you did it the data changes automatically when UI changes and UI changes when data changes. So you can just modify your data property (even from debug console!) and Matreshka will update UI.</p>
		
		<h2>Is it better then X?</h2>
		<p>We know that the internet is full of JavaScript frameworks such as Backbone, Angular, Knockout, React... The guys who did them are really awesome. But all of these frameworks do two bad things (in our humble opinion).</p>
		
		<p>First is most of them create new HTML-subset language that allows to play with HTML like with program language (MVVM pattern). It forces developers to embed application logic to HTML code that is not good as we see it. Matreshka keeps your HTML to be just HTML and application logic is always placed in JavaScript files.</p>
		
		<p>The second is some of these frameworks force developers to keep many essences in their minds and communicate that essences with each other. Everybody who used Backbone knows how painful is job thay do. Mind is blowing when you have to create simple UI widget: "Ok, we're creating model that should communicate with view and should contain collection. Then this collection has to contain models that communicate with their views..." and so on. Applications written with Matreshka makes you do less objects and the task described above needs only two instances: MK.Array as "collection" and MK.Object as "model" (member of collection).</p>
		
		<h2>Free and Open-Source</h2>
		<p>Don't forget that Matreshka is completely open-source and free for any kind of use including commertial use (MIT License). <a href="https://github.com/finom/matreshka">Check out the project on Github and fork it.</a></p>
