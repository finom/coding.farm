		<h2>Why Matreshka?</h2>
		<p>Matreshka is an innovative new framework that makes JavaScript + DOM coding less painful. It opens up new possibilities for developing fast, extendable and clean-coded applications. Matreshka does a lot to keep your code compact, which makes apps less sensitive to errors.</p>
		
		<p>What does "innovative" mean? It means that Matreshka uses the newest features of modern browsers. More precisely, Matreshka uses accessors provided by Object.defineProperty function. Don't forget that Matreshka has hacked Internet Explorer 8 for you, allowing it to work on this browser too.</p>
		
		<h2>Two-way data binding in JavaScript</h2>
		<p>The main goal of Matreshka is to allow you to forget about data-UI-data synchronizations. Simply add a few rules about how data should be communicated with specified HTML elements and that's it! From then on, data changes automatically when UI changes and UI changes when data changes. So you can easily modify some property of an instance, (even from a debug console), and Matreshka will update UI automatically.</p>
		
		<h2>Is it better than X?</h2>
		<p>We know that the internet is full of JavaScript frameworks such as Backbone, Angular, Knockout, React, etc. The guys who created them are really awesome. But all of these frameworks have two major shortcomings.</p>
		
		<p>First, most of them create new HTML-subset languages that allow you to work with HTML, like with program language (MVVM pattern). It forces developers to embed application logic to HTML code, which complicates matters. With Matreshka, your HTML remains simply HTML, and application logic is always placed in JavaScript files.</p>
		
		<p>Secondly, some of these frameworks force developers to keep too many things in mind and communicate these with each other. Everybody who used Backbone knows how painful a job this is. Even creating a simple UI widget becomes an ordeal: "Ok, we're creating model that should communicate with view and should contain collection. Then this collection has to contain models that communicate with their views..." and so on. Applications written with Matreshka are simpler, and the task described above needs only two instances: Matreshka.Array as "collection" and Matreshka.Object as "model" (member of collection).</p>
		
		<h2>Free and Open-Sourced</h2>
		<p>Don't forget that Matreshka is completely open-sourced and free for any purposes, including commercial use (MIT License). <a href="https://github.com/finom/matreshka">Check out the project on Github and fork it.</a></p>
