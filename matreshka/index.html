			<h2>No dirty HTML</h2>
			<p>There're many Javascript frameworks that create new language by extending HTML. Developers that use these frameworks should change HTML code by adding new attributes and new syntax stuff. We love HTML and {% raw %}{{dont.like}}{% endraw %} when application logic goes to HTML code. So one of the main advantages of Matreshka is keeping HTML to be just HTML.</p>
