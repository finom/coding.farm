			<h2>Clean HTML</h2>
			<p>There are many Javascript frameworks that create new language by extending HTML language. Developers that use these frameworks are forced to change HTML code by adding new attributes and syntax. We love HTML and {% raw %}{{dont.like}}{% endraw %} when application logic goes into HTML code. With Matreshka, HTML always remains HTML.</p>

			<article>
			<h2>Clear JavaScript</h2>
			<p>Matreshka was created for developers who want maximum results with minimal effort. People who always forget to explain their code in comments, who don't like confusing abstractions, who like to create clear and understandable code anyone can understand even if they don't know Matreshka syntax.</p>

			<h2>Open-sourced and free</h2>
			<p>Matreshka was developed under MIT license. This means Matreshka is open-sourced and completely free. You can do anything you want with it! The code is stored on Github as a public repository, so anybody can review it.</p>
