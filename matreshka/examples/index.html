	<p>Matreshka is the core class that provides magical possibilities. It contains events engine, data-UI bindings engine, dependences engine and so on. Examples below shows main uses of Matreshka by providing source code and running code. Other examples (for each method) you can find on  <a href="{{page.relative}}matreshka/docs/Matreshka.html">documentation page</a></p>

	<h2 id="mk.object"><a href="#mk.object">MK.Object</a></h2>
	<p>After you got how to work with Matreshka you need to delimit application data from application state. What does it mean? For example, you're developing simple login form. It should have two inputs (login and password), "Show Password" checkbox, "Remember Me" checkbox and submit button. All of these elements represent "application state". Server needs 3 things: login, password, and "Remember Me" option, but it doesn't need to know is password is showing to user or not. So we have login, password and "Remember Me" as data state and login, password, "Remember Me" and "Show Password" as application state. As you see data state is always a subset of application state. <a href="http://jsbin.com/ATAPUCo/9">Check this example out on JSBin</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="mk.array"><a href="#mk.array">MK.Array</a></h2>
	<p><code>MK.Array</code> is responsible for collections in Matreshka apps. It inherits Matreshka class and has same features as Matreshka (events, dependences etc) but provides collection methods.</p>
